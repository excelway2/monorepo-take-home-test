Please be aware that the project currently utilizes a mixed approach to CSS styles:
  -Projects page: Pure CSS
  -Other pages: Tailwind CSS
This is due to a temporary workaround for integrating Tailwind CSS into the project. While the initial nx integration encountered an issue, a CDN link was added to ensure consistent visual presentation on other pages.
