**list of projects as cards, crud operation forms using tailwind css.
**Implemented services to send a request to the back end using its api.
**Implemented controllers and services in the backend
**i apologize for the late response, i had quite some issues with the project since cloning it, the project couldn't run on my pc for some reason, i had to waste a day a half trying to solve the issue, also, i have quite the issue using angular mat, so i had to switch last second to tailwind css, and pure html/css, i could've implemented ant design/ng zorro but i didn't have time for it, thanks for understanding.
